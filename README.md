# HackISU Spring 2017 Project: Open SEC Data

## What this is

The Securities and Exchange Commission is tasked with the enforcement and regulation of much of America's financial markets. This includes requiring various entities, notably publicly traded companies, to file various papers that report critical information. An example would be the liquidity levels (tier 1 and tier 2) for banks such as JP Morgan Chase.

Despite the technical existence of these filings, the ability to easily find them en masse in a friendly manner for someone not familiar with SEC jargon and regulatory infrastructure does not exist. This project hopes to solve this to some extent.
